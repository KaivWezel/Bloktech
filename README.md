## Matching feature

During this project I started working on my first webapplication. The concept is a feature where you can set your interests/hobbies on your profile so people know what you like. This will give you a profile which you can then edit/update or delete from the database.

## Getting started

- Clone repository to local directory/repository using `git clone https://github.com/KaivWezel/Bloktech`.
- Install neccesary packages. `npm install`
- run server `npm run server`

## How to use

* If you have started the server, you can navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser. 
* You will find a simple menu to walk through and create your first profile.
* After creating, your profile will be presented and you have 2 options, edit and delete.
* If you want to edit some information on your profile, click 'bewerken'.
* if you want to delete your profile, click 'verwijderen'
